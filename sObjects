sObjects 

# Declare sObjects - Use the API Name
# For custom objects and custom fields, the API name always ends 
# with the __c suffix. For custom relationship fields, the API name ends with the __r suffix
Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme');

# Creating sObjects and Adding Fields
Account acct = new Account();
Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme', Phone='(415)555-1212', NumberOfEmployees=100);

# Dot Notation
Account acct = new Account();
acct.Name = 'Acme';
acct.Phone = '(415)555-1212';
acct.NumberOfEmployees = 100;

# Generic sObject - When not sure what data type the object
sObject sobj1 = new Account(Name='Trailhead');
sObject sobj2 = new Book__c(Name='Workbook 1');

# Cast a generic sObject to an Account
Account acct = (Account)myGenericSObject;

# Now, you can use the dot notation to access fields on Account
String name = acct.Name;
String phone = acct.Phone;
